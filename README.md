# Graph Algorithms Visualization

Welcome to the Graph Algorithms Visualization project! This web application allows you to visualize various graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms, including DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra's algorithm. Created using React JS, this application provides an interactive and educational experience for users to understand the intricacies of these algorithms.

## App Features

- **Draw Nodes:** Easily add nodes to the graph.
- **Create Edges:** Create both directed and undirected edges between nodes.
- **Edit Edges:** Edit edges to be weighted or unweighted.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from the provided algorithms:
  1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
  3. Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Visualization Controls:** 
  - Pause or continue the visualization process.
  - Reset the graph to start over.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Elmouinysaleh/Graph-Algorithms-Visualization.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Graph-Algorithms-Visualization
    ```
3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Usage

1. **Drawing Nodes:**
   - Click on the canvas area to add nodes.
2. **Creating Edges:**
   - Click on a node and drag to another node to create an edge. 
   - Choose between directed and undirected edges.
3. **Editing Edges:**
   - Click on an edge to toggle between weighted and unweighted.
4. **Selecting Algorithms:**
   - Choose an algorithm from the provided options (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra).
5. **Visualization Controls:**
   - Use the controls to pause, continue, or reset the visualization.
